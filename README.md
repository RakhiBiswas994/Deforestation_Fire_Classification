###  Fire Classification using MODIS Data

This project aims to use machine learning to classify fire events in India by analyzing satellite data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). By recognizing different types of fires—like wildfires or those caused by deforestation—the model helps improve fire tracking and supports better decision-making for forest and environmental management.
